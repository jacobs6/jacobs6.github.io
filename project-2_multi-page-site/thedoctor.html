          <p class="doctor-info">An exile from his homeworld, wandering space and time in his trusty TARDIS with granddaughter Susan, the First Doctor appears to be a frail old man. But don't be fooled.  A mysterious, unsympathetic character, he had little time for humans and showed no hesitation in placing others in dangers if it meant satisfying his own curiosity. He was possibly over-protective of his granddaughter, but his caring qualities were encased in a hard shell of petulance and contempt. With a chuckle and a twinkle in his eye, he has an unquenchable thirst to explore, and a knack of getting himself into trouble doing it. Sometimes doting, sometimes difficult, the First Doctor was both a loving father-figure and a fierce opponent.

          <p class="doctor-info">Overtly playful and eccentric, the second Doctor sometimes appeared to be a likeable but hapless buffoon. And yet his enemies often found out to their cost that this foolish facade concealed the keen mind of a genius! He wore clothes that were too large and showed a penchant for striking and at times comic headwear. But his strange apparel and occasional bumbling disguised an unstoppable force powered by a knowledge of evil and a desire to defeat it. A more playful, whimsical air disguised dark undercurrents and a sharp mind. It wasn't until he was put on trial by his own people - The Time Lords - for interference, that the Second Doctor was forced to regenerate.

          <p class="doctor-info">The Third Doctor cut a dashing figure. A man of action with a passion for gadgets and thrilling forms of transport, he was exiled to Earth for much of his era, deprived of a functioning TARDIS and the knowledge of time travel by the Time Lords. He was confident, bold and brash, but with a soft paternal side, reserved for those he cared about. While exiled he became allied to the extraterrestrial task force UNIT and helped them combat living plastic Autons, Sea Devils and polluted giant green maggots, as well as fellow renegade Time Lord, The Master. Eventually he was allowed to travel again, and on one such trip received a fatal dose of radiation, prompting him to regenerate...

          <p class="doctor-info">The Fourth Doctor has been characterised as a clownish adventurer, eager to dish out jokes and jelly babies. It’s a notion that neglects so much about this fascinating incarnation – this Doctor’s remote, alien nature, his apparent coldness and the fact that his tomfoolery often served to wrong foot his enemies. Always full of ideas and surprises. Forever striding into the next dangerous situation. This zest for life and adventures made him an engaging character. He enjoyed Paris, playing chess and eating jelly babies.He was an adventurer on an epic scale, armed with a gleeful smile, swashbuckling charm and righteous morality.

          <p class="doctor-info">The Fifth Doctor was the Time Lord’s most youthful incarnation up to that point in his life. Clever, considered and kind, this Doctor's world was one of fascination and science. This was a Doctor who wore his hearts on his sleeve, unafraid to display his every emotion. Absolute delight as he played cricket in the 1920s or complete despair after failing to prevent a bloodbath between humans and Silurians. He initially came across as a young, vibrant adventurer, haring into risky escapades without pausing for breath. This openness went hand-in-hand with a sense of vulnerability. He remained a hero to the end when, infected with a deadly virus and with only enough antidote to save one, the Fifth Doctor sacrificed his life to save his friend Peri.

          <p class="doctor-info">The Sixth Doctor was a firework of a Time Lord. Loud. Explosive. Impossible to ignore. He had a wildly unstable start and many might claim he never really settled down…Never understated, this incarnation was an explosion of colours, words and emotions. Passionate, sometimes quick to anger, this was a Doctor you did not want to make enemies with.  pompous and often rude, frequently impatient and about as subtle as his flamboyant clothing. Yet he retained a degree of ‘Doctorish’ charm. He possessed a very emotional heart as well, displaying guarded emotion in certain moments, revealing the over-the-top egocentricity was part of an act to mask his feelings.

          <p class="doctor-info">His Seventh body was both a spoon-playing clown and a master of deep dark secrets. The Seventh Doctor was an inquisitive explorer, revelling in adventure and investigations into the unknown. He might trick you into thinking he was a buffoon, playing the fool or muddling his words – but these traits belied a sharp intelligence and a shrewd judge of character.  He had a propensity for manipulation, carefully maneuvering his enemies into destroying themselves like chess pieces.  This manipulation also extended to his companions however, often putting them in unfair situations and causing strain on their relationships.  The Seventh Doctor went on to have many adventures in books, comic strips and on audio.

          <p class="doctor-info">After dying on the operating table, the Doctor regenerated into his eighth form in a hospital morgue, on December 31, 1999. The Eighth Doctor was an effortlessly charming, romantic figure. He was unguarded about his background and equally candid about what the future held for people he came into contact with. It seems ironic that so much about this open Doctor remains a closed book. After a great many adventures away from the screen, the Eighth Doctor was last seen trying to avoid fighting in the Time War. He was killed in a spaceship crash on Karn, and temporarily revived by its Sisterhood, who begged him to save reality by offering him a choice of regenerative elixirs. But who would he be? Fast or strong? Wise or angry? With a universe at war no longer needing a doctor, he chose to become a warrior…

          <p class="doctor-info">A northern accent. Big smile. Bouts of melancholy and mixed with manic excitement and an offbeat sense of humour. The sole survivor of the Last Great Time War, scarred by the terrible things he’d seen and done, the Ninth Doctor was an intense and emotional incarnation, hiding his psychological trauma behind madcap wit and frivolity.  During his travels with Rose Tyler he could be surprisingly severe, however the shop assistant from the Powell Estate brought out the best of him. She helped him recover from the Time War and showed him the best of humanity, eventually leading to the ultimate sacrifice.

          <p class="doctor-info">Waking on Christmas Day in his new form, The Tenth Doctor was a charismatic mixture of apparent opposites… He could show extraordinary kindness and sensitivity, but he himself admitted he was a man who gave no second chances. As Donna Noble pointed out to him, ‘I think sometimes you need somebody to stop you.’ But by and large the Tenth Doctor was a happy traveller who found wonder in everything from quirky little words to a rampaging werewolf. He roamed time and space with Rose Tyler, Mickey Smith, Martha Jones and Donna Noble and all of them showed him tremendous loyalty. No wonder Sarah Jane declared, ‘You've got the biggest family on Earth!’

          <p class="doctor-info">The Doctor, in his eleventh incarnation, is an excited explorer of the universe, with a keen intelligence that means he often notices what everyone else has missed. Hugely energetic, occasionally flirtatious, and by his own admission, "a mad man", the Eleventh Doctor combined youthful looks with an old soul. But his excitement sometimes results in him tripping over himself and walking into things. He enjoys anything that's different and interesting, and as always he has a powerful sense of right and wrong and a determination to do what's right. His dress sense might be a bit... odd. But he knows that bowties are cool.

          <p class="doctor-info">Granted a whole new regenerative cycle by the Time Lords, Clara could scarcely believe that the Twelfth Doctor was the same Time Lord who had introduced her to so many adventures throughout time and space. The genial nature was gone and in its place she found a sharp, impatient and at times insensitive soul who was quick to criticize. The Twelfth Doctor may not be big on hugs but he’s still brave, heroic and drawn to danger… But there is a dark side. When Clara light-heartedly called herself his carer he agreed with his companion, adding ‘She cares so I don’t have to…’ Yet so much of the ‘old Doctors’ remains intact… He’s still funny and able to make jokes in the most dire situations.

          <p class="doctor-info">The Thirteenth Doctor is a livewire, full of energy and fizzing with excitement and wit from the very first moment we meet her! This Doctor loves to be surrounded by friends – in fact she treats her travelling companions Yaz, Ryan and Graham more like family, often boosting their confidence by telling them how great they are. Like her previous incarnations, the Doctor is brave and selfless – a hero who will run towards danger without hesitation. Though she may be a fidget and a wanderer, she’ll always answer a call for aid when she hears it. In her own words, ‘When people need help, I never refuse.’
