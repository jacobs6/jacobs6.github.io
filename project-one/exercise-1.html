      <h2>Changa</h2>
      <p>Changa is a typeface designed by Argentinian type designer Eduardo Tunni.  It was intended to be a display typeface, so it was developed with a singular height so it could be used with minimal line spacing.  Each letter was designed around a square, creating a contrast between the interior shapes and the curved contours.  This contrast is part of what drew my eye to the typeface in the first place.  The typeface was also developed to be compatible with Arabic scripts.</p>
